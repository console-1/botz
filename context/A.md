Below is a structured set of recommendations that answers every question in the prompt, keeping the original headings and numbering. In short, the most economical yet reliable architecture today pairs **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** on a lightweight vector database (e.g., Qdrant or Chroma) with a **budget-tier API model such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Haiku, or Mixtral 8x7B**, or with an **on-device model such as Phi-3-mini** for clients that need strict data residency. Each client's knowledge base is chunked, embedded, and stored in its own logical namespace; a per-client prompt template injects brand tone and style at runtime. The front end is a drop-in React/TypeScript widget that calls your API and gracefully escalates to a human when confidence is low. Everything below fills in the implementation details and business trade-offs.

# Customer Service Bot Requirements - Questions & Clarifications (answered)

## Technical Architecture

### Knowledge Base Management

1. **Format** – Store raw content in Markdown or HTML, then preprocess into chunks and keep embeddings in a vector DB (Qdrant, Chroma) for fast semantic search. Use **semantic chunking** over fixed-size chunking for better retrieval quality, and implement **hybrid search** (semantic + keyword) for improved factual query performance. [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/what-is-a-vector-database/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  
2. **Typical size** – SMB support sites usually run 100 – 1,000 articles (5 – 50 MB of text; ≈ 50k – 500k tokens). This easily fits in local RAM for inexpensive RAG.
  
3. **Content types** – Primarily text + metadata. Images or PDFs can be OCR-extracted so the model reasons over alt-text; links and structured FAQ JSON are fine as extra metadata fields.
  
4. **Versioning** – Yes; keep a version tag on each document so you can roll back or A/B-test revisions. Implement **content fingerprinting** to avoid re-embedding unchanged chunks and **prompt versioning** alongside content versioning for testing different instruction sets.
  
5. **Storage location** – Object storage (e.g., S3 or Azure Blob) for source files, vector DB for embeddings, Postgres for metadata.
  
6. **Update cadence** – Near-real-time is possible (stream new docs through the embedder and upsert). For most clients, nightly batch refresh is sufficient unless they run frequent release notes.
  

### LLM Integration

1. **Budget** – GPT-3.5 Turbo costs $0.001 / 1K input tokens and $0.002 / 1K output tokens, so 1M tokens ≈ $3; Claude 3.5 Haiku offers better reasoning at similar cost; a 100K-token month per client is ≈ $0.30. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[OpenAI Community](https://community.openai.com/t/congrats-on-gpt-3-5-turbo-1106/493385?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  
2. **Providers** – Recommend a tiered approach: GPT-3.5 Turbo or Claude 3.5 Haiku for general English, Mixtral 8×7B via Mistral-API for cheaper bulk traffic [DocsBot AI](https://docsbot.ai/tools/gpt-openai-api-pricing-calculator?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and on-prem Phi-3-mini for clients with strict data-sovereignty needs [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-phi-3-redefining-whats-possible-with-slms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
  
3. **Response time** – < 1s target; GPT-3.5 Turbo round-trips are typically 300 – 800ms outside peak; local Phi-3 is sub-200ms on a consumer GPU.
  
4. **Multilingual** – All three models above are multilingual in major languages (EN/ES/FR/DE/etc.) with minor quality trade-offs.
  
5. **Conversation history** – Maintain rolling context windows (last N turns or 5K tokens) for follow-up questions. Implement **conversation summarization** rather than just truncation to preserve context when approaching limits.
  
6. **Escalation** – Yes; when confidence < X % (based on retrieval score + response uncertainty + domain-specific validation), return a routed ticket to a human. Use **structured outputs** (JSON schema) for better integration with escalation systems.
  

### Bot Behavior & Customization

1. **Tone config** – Use a per-client JSON file with fields like `voice`, `persona`, `no_data_reply`, injected into the system prompt.
  
2. **Tone variations** – Supported personas: professional, warm, casual, technical, playful.
  
3. **Multiple personas** – Each client can define multiple personas if they have product lines (select via metadata in the request).
  
4. **Fallback** – Return **context-aware fallbacks** with different responses for "I don't know" vs "I found conflicting information" plus escalation link when no KB passage is above the threshold.
  
5. **Clarifying questions** – Enabled; ask user for missing order number, product variant, etc., when required fields are absent.
  
6. **Analytics** – Capture events through LangChain/LLMonitor callback handlers for latency, cost, success rate, sentiment, etc. Consider **LangChain alternatives** like LlamaIndex or direct API calls for better performance/simplicity. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/callbacks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  

## Client Management

### Multi-tenancy

1. **Client ID** – Pass an API key or sub-domain slug; the backend uses it to select the correct vector namespace and prompt template.
  
2. **Isolation** – Logical isolation (separate DB schemas + namespace in vector store). For high-compliance clients, allow dedicated physical clusters. Implement **resource quotas** per tenant to prevent abuse. [Relevant Software](https://relevant.software/blog/multi-tenant-architecture/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Acropolium](https://acropolium.com/blog/saas-app-architecture-2022-overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  
3. **Branding** – CSS variables and logo URL in the widget manifest.
  
4. **Self-managed KB** – Provide a simple dashboard or S3 bucket upload; auto-ingest pipeline runs on upload.
  
5. **Admin panel** – Yes; SaaS-style dashboard with user roles, billing, usage, model settings. Include **gradual rollout** mechanisms for new model versions per client and **cross-tenant analytics** (aggregated/anonymized) for platform insights.
  

### Deployment

1. **Hosting model** – Default SaaS; optional Docker helm chart for self-hosted clients.
  
2. **White-label** – Hide your logo/URL when `whiteLabel=true`.
  
3. **Cloud** – AWS (Qdrant on EC2, S3, Lambda) or Azure (Phi-3 via Azure AI) for model diversity. **Vector database choice** depends on scale: Qdrant for growth, Chroma for simplicity, Pinecone for enterprise.
  
4. **On-prem** – Provide an offline Docker compose bundle with Ollama-served Phi-3-mini if required. Include **data residency** options for different regions.
  

## User Interface

### Chat Interface

1. **Embeddable widget** – Yes; provide a `<script>` snippet that inserts a floating button that expands to a React modal. Similar to Microsoft's Dynamics chat embed pattern. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/embed-chat-widget-portal?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  
2. **Mobile-responsive** – Use CSS flexbox and media queries; modal snaps to full width on small screens.
  
3. **Features** – Typing indicators, rich-text replies, optional file-upload (for order invoices), emoji reactions. Implement **progressive disclosure** for complex queries (show simple response first, then "show more details") and **conversation branching** for multi-topic discussions.
  
4. **Chat history** – Persist in localStorage (for anonymity) or user ID (if logged-in) for 30 days.
  
5. **Authentication** – Optional JWT; default is anonymous with a per-session UUID.
  
6. **Accessibility** – Ensure **WCAG 2.1 compliance** for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
  

### Landing Page

1. **Purpose** – Primarily demo; doubles as marketing lead capture.
  
2. **Showcase** – Tab switcher showing various client themes.
  
3. **Switch client demos** – Query-string `?client=acme` swaps KB and styling live.
  

## Data & Privacy

### Security

1. **Regulations** – GDPR by default; optionally CCPA, POPIA for South Africa. Key is "privacy-by-design" logging minimization. [Gerrish Legal](https://www.gerrishlegal.com/quick-tips/chatbots-and-privacy-by-design-a-few-tips-to-ensure-gdpr-compliance?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  
2. **Chat logs** – Store 30 days (configurable); mask emails/phones via regex before storage. Implement **audit logging** for all model interactions.
  
3. **Encryption** – TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest.
  
4. **Sensitive data** – Use server-side DLP filters; do not embed PII into vector store (store only hashed references). Implement **prompt injection detection** as attacks become more sophisticated.
  

### Integration

1. **Webhooks** – Outbound webhooks on events (`new_ticket`, `feedback_submitted`).
  
2. **CRM** – Pre-built connectors for HubSpot, Salesforce. Consider **Zapier integration** for long-tail CRM/ticketing systems.
  
3. **API** – REST/GraphQL endpoints for send/receive, metrics, KB upload.
  
4. **Handoff** – Web-based agent console or email pipe when escalation is triggered.
  

## Business Requirements

### Scalability

1. **Concurrency** – Target 500 simultaneous sessions per pod; autoscale horizontally via Kubernetes HPA.
  
2. **Clients** – MVP: 3 paying clients; roadmap: 50 within 12 months.
  
3. **Message volume** – SMB retail averages 1,000 msgs/month; enterprise SaaS ~10k.
  

### Features

1. **A/B testing** – Toggle prompt variants per-group; measure CSAT via LangChain callbacks.
  
2. **Rich media responses** – Allowed; serve product images or PDF manuals.
  
3. **Sentiment analysis** – spaCy or Hugging Face classifier in pipeline for mood tagging. [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Medium](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/ai-in-the-real-world-2-sentiment-analysis-using-spacy-pipelines-b39a2618d7c1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  
4. **Learning loop** – **Must-have**: Log unresolved questions, push to fine-tune or expand KB weekly. Critical for quality improvement.
  

### Technology Preferences

1. **Backend** – Python (FastAPI + LangChain) for fastest ML ecosystem; TS/Node is viable if you prefer a single language stack.
  
2. **Frontend** – React + TypeScript; widget published to npm.
  
3. **Database** – Postgres for relational data; Qdrant/Chroma for vectors; Redis for short-lived sessions.
  
4. **Existing infra** – If client already on AWS, reuse S3 + RDS; otherwise default to your chosen cloud.
  

## Timeline & Development

1. **MVP timeline** – 6 weeks: week 1 design, week 2 KB pipeline, week 3 LLM integration, week 4 widget, week 5 multi-tenant auth, week 6 compliance & logging. Add explicit milestones for **load testing**, **monitoring/alerting setup**, and **client feedback integration** process.
  
2. **Must-haves** – RAG flow, per-client tone, basic widget, admin KB upload, GDPR logging, **learning loop**. **Nice-to-haves** – A/B testing, sentiment, white-label portal.
  
3. **Maintenance** – Yes; monthly security patches and model-cost optimization.
  
4. **Extensibility** – Follow clean hex-architecture; each capability (auth, RAG, analytics) behind its own interface so you can swap models or storage later. **Abstract the LLM interface early** since model landscape changes rapidly. Note that centralizing vectors can create security gaps; agent-based per-source querying is an emerging alternative.
